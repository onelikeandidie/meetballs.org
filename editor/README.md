This is a layout for zellij that automatically launches the laravel server
and the `npm run dev` command. It also has a tab for the laravel logs, a
tab for git, and a tab for the terminal.

If you've never used zellij before, here's a quick rundown of how to use it:

- You can move between panes using `Alt` + arrow keys or `Alt` + `hjkl`.
- You can resize panes using `Alt` + `+` or `Alt` + `-`.
- Exit zellij by pressing `Ctrl` + `q`.

Other instructions are at the bottom of the editor as well as button hints
as you click around. You can also use your mouse to click on the tabs at the
top of the screen to switch tabs.

You can close this tutorial with `Ctrl` + `c`.
