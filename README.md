# Meetballs.org website

This is the source code for the Meetballs.org website. Currently, it lists
some of the projects worked on during the [Meetballs](https://meetballs.org)
developer meetups. The projects can be the script from the host of the meetup,
or a project that was worked on during the meetup.

## Development

The codebase is based on Rocket.rs, Tera templating and Tailwind CSS. To make
sure you have all the required components install Rust from
[rust-lang.org](https://rust-lang.org) and Node.js (along with npm)
[nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org), then run:

```bash
# Install tailwind
npm install
```

To compile styles and run the site locally run the following:

```bash
# Automatically runs tailwind using the build.rs file
cargo run
```

To make sure the styles get compiled whenever you change a template file, you
will have to install `cargo-watch` to add the the ability for cargo to watch
for changes and recompile.

```bash
# Install globaly
cargo install --locked cargo-watch
# Watch for changes and recompile styles
cargo watch
# Watch for changes and recompile whole site
# -x makes cargo run the following command whenever something changes
cargo watch -x run
```
